                    <p>Head over to our Discord and download the latest release in the #downloads channel. Afterwards, follow the readme.md file included with the download for further instructions.</p>
                    <p>We do not advice following YouTube tutorials. They're often outdated compared to our own documentation.</p>

                    </h3>
                    <p>The releases follow a pattern with 3 numbers:</p>
                    <p>The first number (x.0.0) means it's a major release with new features that requires you to regenerate the OTR. How to do this is explained <a href="#how-do-i-update-ship-of-harkinian">here</a>.</p>
                    <p>The second number (0.x.0) means it's a major release with new features that doesn't require a new OTR.</p>
                    <p>The third number (0.0.x) means it's a bugfix release that doesn't require a new OTR.</p>
                    <p>Major releases always have their own name, usually a character's name from a Sci-fi movie. Bugfix releases follow the NATO phonetic alphabet (Alfa, Bravo, Charlie, etc).</p>

                      <li>Head over to our Discord and download the latest release in the #downloads channel.</li>
                      <li>For all platforms, extract the files from the newer version to your existing SoH directory, overwriting the old files.</li>
                      <li>
                        When updating to a newer major release that requires a new OTR (see above), do the following:
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>Windows:</strong> Delete your current .otr files and the Extract folder inside the folder you have SoH installed in. Afterwards, generate the OTR like you did when first installing SoH.</li>
                          <li><strong>Linux/SteamDeck:</strong> Delete the .otr files inside the folder you have SoH installed in. Afterwards, generate the OTR like you did when first installing SoH.</li>
                          <li><strong>MacOS:</strong> Delete the .otr files inside the ~/Library/Application Support/com.shipofharkinian.soh folder. Afterwards, generate the OTR like you did when first installing SoH.</li>
                          <li><strong>Wii U/Switch:</strong> Generate the OTR on your PC platform of choice, then replace the OTR on your Wii U/Switch with the new one. Make sure the version used to generate the OTR is the same as what you're playing with on Wii U/Switch.</li>

                    <p>This is a project done by volunteers during their spare time for free. The work gets accomplished by whoever's
                      interested in implementing what, with a few things being prioritized as milestones for stable releases.
                      To set deadlines would be to create unrealistic expectations that would likely never be met and cause disappointment.
